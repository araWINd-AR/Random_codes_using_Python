# Python Turtle Graphics Collection

This repository contains a collection of creative and visual projects built using **Python Turtle Graphics**.
The goal of these projects is to explore programming concepts through **art, mathematics, and visualization**, rather than traditional text-based output.

Each program uses logic, geometry, and repetition to generate visually appealing patterns, shapes, and designs.

## About This Repository

These projects were created as part of my learning journey with Python.
They helped me understand how loops, functions, angles, coordinates, and mathematical formulas can be combined to create meaningful visual output.

The focus is not just on drawing shapes, but on **thinking logically and creatively using code**.

## What You Will Find Here

This repository includes multiple Turtle Graphics programs such as:

* Heart shapes created using mathematical equations
* Heart designs with custom messages displayed inside
* Simple, colorful, and realistic flower drawings
* Geometric star patterns (single star, six-pointed star, radial designs)
* Spiral and rosette-style mathematical patterns
* Radial burst and symmetry-based designs
* A detailed Shiva Lingam drawing created using structured geometry

All designs are generated completely through Python code.

## Project Highlights

* Built using Python’s built-in `turtle` module
* Strong use of loops, functions, angles, and coordinates
* Mathematical logic applied to generate patterns
* Creative and visually engaging outputs
* Beginner-friendly yet conceptually meaningful

These projects combine **logic, math, and creativity** into simple but powerful programs.

## How to Run the Programs

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Run any file using:

```
python filename.py
```

A Turtle Graphics window will open and automatically draw the design.
